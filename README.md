Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications using methodologies. It is reliable, scalable, and efficient for software solutions that power businesses, communication, healthcare, finance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The milestones of software engineering are mastery complexity, mastery process and mastery machine.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

There are seven (7) life cycles of software engineering which are:
Planning – Defining objectives, scope, and purpose.
Requirements Analysis – Identifying user specifications.
Design – Building the framework.
Coding - Converting software design to tangible code.
Testing – Identifying and fixing defects through various tests.
Deployment – Releasing the software for use.
Maintenance – Updating and improving software post-release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology is step by step, changes are dificult, late feedback while the agile methodology is a continuous cycle, very flexible, and there is frequent feedback.
Example of where they use the waterfall methodology is in government projects and healthcare software.
Example of where tthey use the agile methodology is in startups and mobile app developments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Ensures software quality through testing and identifying bugs.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, team coordination, and stakeholder communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide coding, debugging, and testing tools in one platform (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Help manage code changes and collaboration (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging Complex Code → Use logging and debugging tools.
Meeting Deadlines → Prioritize tasks using Agile or Kanban boards.
Keeping Up with New Technologies → Continuous learning through courses and coding practice.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., functions, methods).
    Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
    System Testing – Validates the entire system's behavior.
    Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the software meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise and well-structured instructions to interact effectively with AI models. It is crucial because a well-designed prompt leads to better, more accurate responses from AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the key differences between electric and gasoline cars, including their environmental impact and cost efficiency."
Why the Improved Prompt is Better?

    More Specific – Focuses on electric vs. gasoline cars.
    Clearer Objective – Asks for differences, environmental impact, and cost.
    Concise – Uses direct language to guide the AI.
